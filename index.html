				<h2>Oil</h2>
				<p>
					You can attack with a flask of oil by throwing it at one creature 
or object within medium range. Make an Agility attack roll against the 
target’s Agility. On a success, the oil covers the target and it remains
 covered until it spends 1 minute clearing it away. If a creature or 
object covered in oil takes damage from fire or lightning, the oil 
catches fire and deals 1d6 damage to the target. The target takes 1d6 
damage at the end of each round for 1d6 rounds. A creature can use an 
action to extinguish the flames.

				<h2>Poison</h2>
				<p>
					You can use an action to apply poison to an edged or pointed 
weapon; to coat up to three arrows, bolts, or darts; or to sprinkle the 
poison into food or drink. When treated with poison, weapons and 
ammunition remain poisonous for 1 hour or until they deal damage.
				</p>
				<p>
					A creature that takes damage from the weapon or piece of ammunition
 must make a Strength challenge roll. On a failure, the creature becomes
 poisoned for 1 minute. If the creature is already poisoned, it takes 
1d6 extra damage.

				<p>
					A creature that consumes poisonous food or drink must make a 
Strength challenge roll with 1 bane. On a failure, the creature takes 
1d6 damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. If already poisoned by the
 food or drink, it takes 3d6 extra damage.

					A poisoned creature, from either use, must make a Strength

				<h2>Incapacitated</h2>
				A creature becomes incapacitated when its damage
total equals its Health score. If the creature is a player
character, the player rolls a d6 and consults the Fate
table below to determine what happens. Any other
creature falls <a href="#prone">prone</a> upon becoming incapacitated, and
the GM decides whether the creature also becomes
<a href="#unconscious">unconscious</a> for 1d3 hours or the creature dies.
				<ul>
				
											<li>Result: 1 = The character dies immediately.</li>
											<li>Result: 2 = The character falls prone and becomes
												unconscious. The character dies after 1d3 rounds
												unless healed.</li>
											<li>Result: 3 = The character becomes unconscious and dies
												after 1d6 minutes unless healed.</li>
											<li>Result: 4 = The character becomes unconscious for 1d6
												minutes and then heals 1 damage.</li>
											<li>Result: 5 = The character becomes unconscious for 1d3
												rounds and then heals 1 damage.</li>
											<li>Result: 6 = The character becomes unconscious for 1 round
												and then heals 1 damage.</li>
												</ul>

												<p>When an incapacitated character heals any damage,
													the character removes the unconscious affliction and
													becomes <a href="#impaired">impaired</a> for 1 minute. If an incapacitated

• When another player rolls a d20, you can expend Fortune to grant 2 boons to the roll.<br>
• When a creature rolls a d20, you can expend Fortune to grant 2 banes to the roll.<br>
• When any player (including you) rolls a d6, you can expend Fortune to replace the number on the die with a 6.<br>
• Take another turn during the round. <br>
• Heal damage equal to twice the character’s 
healing rate <br>

<p>Once you expend it, you do not have Fortune until you level up again.</p>
