				<h2>Traditions
					of Magic</h2>
				
All spells belong to traditions. Each tradition describes a
category of magical effects that share common characteristics.<p></p>
<h3>Associated
	Attributes</h3>
Traditions are associated with
either Intellect or Will. You use the tradition’s associated
attribute when making a attribute roll as part
of casting a spell from the tradition.

<p></p><h3>Discovering
	Traditions</h3>
To cast the spells associated with a tradition, you must
discover the tradition. Discovery indicates
you have learned the fundamental techniques required to cast
spells from the tradition, represented by learning one of its rank 0 spells. <p></p>

<h2>Learning Spells</h2>
If your path allows you to use magic, its rules text tells you
when you can learn a new spell. When your path instructs
you to do so, choose one spell from a tradition you have
discovered and whose rank is equal to or lower than your
Power score.<p></p>
<h2>Exchanging Spells</h2>
Whenever you learn a new spell, you can exchange a spell
you have previously learned for another spell of the same
or lower rank. Such adjustments reflect the changing
nature of magic and the development of your character’s
abilities.<p></p>

		<div class="modal" id="goad">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Goad</h2>
				You can use a reaction
 on your turn to goad one creature you can see.
If the creature can understand what you say, the target makes attribute rolls against you
with 1 boon and makes attribute rolls against any other
target with 1 bane until the end of the next round. On a
failure, the target is immune to your goading until it
completes a rest.
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="modal" id="Isolate">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Isolate</h2>
				When you use an action to make an attack against a
				creature you can reach, you can use a reaction
				to isolate the target, causing it to focus its attention
				on you. The target remains isolated until the end of
				the next round or until you can no longer reach it.
				While it is isolated, you impose 1 bane on attribute rolls
				it makes against targets other than you.
			</div>
		</div>



		<div class="modal" id="unarmed">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Unarmed</h2>
				You punch, kick, elbow, or headbutt. Choose one
creature in reach. Make a Strength roll with 1 bane
against the target’s Defense. On a success, the
target takes 1 Wound. <p></p>

<h2>Shove</h2>
You attempt to shove a creature away from you.
Choose one creature in reach whose size is no
more than 2 higher than yours. Make a Strength
roll against the target’s Strength. You roll with 1
boon if you are using a shield and 1 boon if you
moved at least 5 yards before you make the
attempt. On a success, you push the target a
number of yards away from you equal to your
Strength modifier (minimum 1). If the target is
larger than you, it moves half the distance
(minimum 0) instead. If the result of your roll is 20
or higher, the target falls prone.<p></p>
<h2>Trip</h2>
You attempt to knock a creature to the ground.
Choose one creature in your reach whose size is
no more than 2 higher than yours. Make an Agility
roll against the target’s choice of Strength or
Agility. If you are using a shield, you roll with 1
boon. On a success, the target falls prone. If the
result of your roll is 20 or higher, the target’s
Speed drops to 0 until the start of your next turn.<p></p>
<h2>Grab</h2>
You try to grab a creature. Choose one creature in
your reach whose size is no more than 1 higher
than yours. Make a Strength or Agility roll against
the target's Agility. You succeed automatically
against a held creature. On a success, the target
becomes held until the end of your next turn. The
affliction ends early if you release the target,
which you can do freely. The effect also ends if you
move away from the target without dragging it
(see Drag) or you become confused, controlled,
stunned, or unconscious.
If you have a target grabbed, you can use an
action extend the duration until the end of your
next turn.<p></p>
<h2>Drag</h2>
You attempt to pull a creature you have held with
you. Make a Strength roll against the Strength of a
creature held by your successful grab. On a
success, you move as normal and the creature 
moves with you.<p></p>
<h2>Wrestle</h2>
You attempt to wrestle down a creature you have
grabbed. Make a Strength or Agility roll against the
target’s choice of Strength or Agility. On a success,
you can choose one of the following effects:<br>
• The target falls prone and the grab effect ends.<br>
• You and the target falls prone.<br>
• The target takes 1d6 damage.<br>
• If you and the target are both prone, you pin the
target. A pinned creature is confused, held,
weakened, and cannot stand up until the effect
ends. The target remains until you release it,
which you can do at any time, you stand up or
you use an action to do anything other than
wrestle the target. Also, you release a target
automatically if you become confused, impaired,
stunned, or weakened.<p></p>
<h2>Escape</h2>
If you are held from being grabbed or pinned, you
can attempt to escape by making a Strength or
Agility roll against the Strength or Agility of the
creature that has you held. On a success, you end
the held affliction. If the result of your roll is 20 or
higher and exceeds the target number by at least
5, you can also automatically grab the creature
that had grabbed you or pin the creature that had
you pinned provided the creature can be a
legitimate target for your grab.

				<h2>Fortune</h2>
				When the group does something particularly
				heroic or interesting, you can grant the group
				fortune. The group either has fortune or it doesn’t.
				Granting this reward encourages good roleplaying
				and investment in the story as expending fortune
				can tip the scales in the players’ favor.<br>
				Any member of the group, with everyone’s
				permission can expend fortune to produce one of
				the following effects. <br><br>
				<b>Automatic Success</b> When a character would
				make an attribute roll or luck roll, the character
				can expend fortune to replace the number rolled
				on the die with a 20.<br>
				<b>Heal Damage</b> A character can expend fortune to
				heal all wounds.<br>
				<b>Double Damage</b> A character can expend
				fortune to double the amount of damage dealt
				by an attack, talent, or spell to a single target.<br>
				<b>Get a Clue</b> You give the group an important
				piece of information that pertains to their quest.<br>
				<b>Bend Reality</b> The player changes a
circumstance in a useful manner. The character
might bump into someone with the information
they need, cause an unfriendly character to
suddenly become friendly, or find the lever to
disarm a particularly nasty trap.

				object you can see. Double your Speed score until
				the end of your turn. If you move toward the target
				and can reach it before the end of your turn, you

				but you roll with 1 bane.		</div> </div>

				<h2>Attributes</h2>
				 All characters, most creatures, and some objects
					make use of a set of four attributes to describe
					their most fundamental capabilities. The
					attributes are: Strength, Agility, Intellect, and Will. <p></p>

					<h2>Strength</h2>
Strength represents muscle power, durability,
certain forms of athletic ability, and overall fitness.
You make a Strength roll to resist an effect that
forces you to move or that restrains you, as well as
when you climb, swim, attack with most hand-to-hand
weapons, kick down a door, or overpower
another creature. You also use Strength to
withstand or fight off the effects of pain, injury,
poison, or infection.

<h3>Examples</h3> 
• Climb and Swim<br>
• Run<br>
• Break<br>
• Withstand poison or infection<br>
• Melee attack<br>
• Unarmed attack<p></p>

<h2>Agility</h2>
Agility encompasses poise, dexterity, balance, and
reflexes. You make an Agility roll when you want
to keep your balance, perhaps because someone
has just shoved you or you are moving across
challenging terrain. Agility also comes Into play
when you would try to accomplish a task that
requires manual dexterity, such as picking a lock,
disarming a trap, or performing an act of
legerdemain.
<h3>Examples</h3>
• Balance<br>
• Leap<br>
• Dodge<br>
• Ranged attack<br>
• Unarmed attack<br>
• Pick a lock and Disarm a trap<p></p>

<h2>Intellect</h2>
Intellect measures of intelligence, wit, memory,
and knowledge. You make an Intellect roll to
thwart an effort to deceive you, decipher a coded
message, or outwit another creature. Intellect also
affects your ability to use some forms of magic
successfully.
<h3>Examples</h3>
• Recall<br>
• Solve<br>
• Deceive<br>
• Cast a spell<br>
• Spot an illusion<br>
• Find a clue<p></p>

<h2>Will</h2>
Will describes courage, willpower, resolve, and
mental fortitude. You make a Will roll to resist an
effort to erode your confidence, manipulate your
emotions, or terrify you. As with Intellect, Will is
also needed to use some forms of magic
successfully.
<h3>Examples</h3>
• Intimidate <br>
• Persuade<br>
• Fight off fear<br>
• Resist mind control<br>
• Cast a spell<br>
• Not stress<p></p>
			</div>

				<h2>Attribute Rolls</h2>
				
				Roll a d20, add
					the modifier for your attribute, and then compare
					the result to the target number. You get a success if
					the result equals or exceeds the target number or
					a failure if it doesn't. <p></p>

					<h2>Luck Rolls</h2>
			
				Sometimes, the rules or Sage calls for a luck roll to
see what happens. A luck roll uses no attribute, so
its just a roll of a d20. Since you never make a luck
roll against a creature or object, the target is
always 10. <p>
</p>
<!--<h3> Luck Ends</h3>
	 If you are under the effects of an
	effect that has the (luck ends) notation, you make
	a luck roll at the end of the round. If you have
	multiple (luck ends) effects affecting you, you
	make the luck roll for each effect, in any order you
	choose. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure,
	the effect persists at least until the end of the next
	round, at which point you repeat the luck roll to
	end the effect.-->

		<div class="modal" id="boon">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Boons and Banes</h2>
				A boon is an advantageous circumstance that
					improves your chance of success. For each boon
					that applies, you roll a boon die, which is a d6. You
					then add the highest number rolled on any one of
					the d6s to your attribute roll.
					<p></p>
					A bane is a disadvantage that reduces your
					chance of success. For each bane that applies, you
					roll a bane die, which is a d6. You then subtract the
					highest number rolled on any one of the d6s from
					your attribute roll.<p></p>
					Boons and banes cancel each other out on a one-for-one basis before any boon dice or bane dice
					are rolled.
			</div>

		<div class="modal" id="chi">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				
				 <h2>Wounds</h2>
					Wounds describes how many hits a creature can take. It represents one’s durability,
					resilience, stamina, luck and the ability to avoid lasting
					injury from being attacked.  <p></p>
					
					<h2>Endurance</h2>
All creatures can recover from Wounds, given enough time.
A creature’s Endurance is how many Wounds it heals after
it completes a rest or when targeted by an effect that heals
Wounds. A creature’s Endurance equals one-quarter its
Wound maximum (minimum 1). If the creature’s Wound maximum increases, its
Endurance also increases. <p></p>

<h2>Speed</h2>
Speed in Altier is a bit abstract with Zone combat. To move from zone to zone you neeed at least 5 yards of Speed. Other movement rules describe types of movement and how much Speed you need
to complete said action. <p></p>

<h2>Defense</h2>
Defense shows how reflexes, combat training,
instinct, and protective equipment contribute to a
creature or object’s ability to escape harm from
attacks.

<h3>Natural Defense</h3> All creatures and objects
capable of defending themselves have an natural
Defense score. This score is equal to your Agility. 
<p></p>

<h2>Stress</h2>
Characters are often thrust into dangerous and high-stakes situations, fighting for their 
lives or the safety of others. Consistent exposure to these scenarios and conflict with powerful enemies causes strain. Stress measures this mental toll.
<h3>Stress Total</h3>
All characters begin with Stress 0. You cannot gain more Stress than your Will score + ½ your level.
<h3>Gaining Stress</h3>
Certain situations will cause you to gain Stress, as directed by the rules or the Sage's discretion. Whenever you gain Stress, you become strained 
for 1d3 rounds. If you would gain Stress while you were already strained, add 1 round to the duration.
When your Stress total reaches its maximum, you instead Stress Out.

<h3>Stressing Out</h3>
When you stress out, you remove the strained affliction gained from Stress and roll a d6. The Sage will let you know what happens to your PC.
Afterwards, clear all Stress.

<h3>Reducing Stress</h3>
When you complete a rest, you may reduce your Stress by 1d3+2. <p></p>

<h2>Power</h2>
Power describes a creature’s ability to harness and direct
magical power. A creature’s Power score determines the
highest rank of spell it can learn and how often it can cast
the spells it knows.<br>
Most creatures have Power 0. Player characters can
increase their Power based on the paths they choose. <p></p>

		<div class="modal" id="iad">
			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Injured</h2>

				You are injured while your have taken half your total Wounds. Being injured doesn’t normally change
your capabilities, though some effects, talents, and traits
can interact with this state. <p></p>

<h2>Death Blow</h2>
When a creature takes damage from a single source
and that damage equals or exceeds the creature’s
maximum Wound, the creature must make a Strength roll. On a success, the creature dies after 1d3 rounds
unless healed before then; on a failure, the creature
dies immediately.
				
 <p></p>
<h2>Incapacitated</h2>

A creature becomes incapacitated when they take their maximum amount of Wounds. Upon becoming incapacitated, the
creature falls prone and become defenseless. A creature remains incapacitated until
it removes a Wound. If the creature
takes any damage while incapacitated, it dies. At the end of a round, any Incapacitated creatures make a
Luck Roll to determine what happens to them.

<p></p>

<h2>Healing Wounds</h2>
Creatures heal Wounds by resting or from equipment,
certain talents, and healing magic. 
<h3>Resting</h3>
You can benefit from a rest once per 24 hours. A rest is
a period of inactivity that lasts about 8 hours. During
this time, you can sleep, meditate, read, eat and drink, or
perform other non-strenuous tasks. When you complete
the rest, you heal Wounds equal to your Endurance. You
can extend the period of rest to a full 24 hours. At the end
of this time, you heal wounds equal to twice your Endurance instead.
If something interrupts the rest for more than 1 minute,
the time spent resting is wasted and you must start the rest
over from the beginning to gain any benefit from it. 
<h3>Regroup</h3>
 A character must spend 10
minutes resting, cleaning and binding wounds,
eating, drinking, or performing any other activity that
requires minimal effort. At the end of this time, the
character heals damage equal to his or her Edurance. Once a character regroups, the character cannot
do so again until he or she completes a rest.<p></p>

<h2>Death</h2>
When a creature dies, it becomes an object. Dead creatures
cannot be restored to life by healing their damage. Creatures who are not properly cremated will be resurrected by the Undying King’s Curse.

			<a href="#_" class="modal-close"></a>
			<div class="modal-dialog">
				<h2>Afflictions</h2>
				Afflictions describe a variety of harmful effects that alter or
limit what creatures can normally do. The effect that imposes
the affliction tells you how long it lasts and what can be done
to remove it. If it doesn’t specify, the affliction is permanent. If you gain an affliction you already have, there is usually
no additional effect, but you must remove each instance of
the affliction to end its effect on you. <p></p>

				<h2>Asleep</h2>
				A sleeping creature is prone and unconscious. Another
				creature that can reach it can use an action to wake it
				up. Unless otherwise noted, taking damage removes this
				affliction.
 <p></p>
				
				<h2>Blinded</h2>
				A blinded creature cannot see. It treats its surroundings
				as totally obscured. Other creatures
				make attribute rolls with 1 boon against a blinded creature’s
				Defense. <p></p>

				<h2>Charmed</h2>
A charmed creature sees the source of the affliction as
a trusted friend and ally. The charmed creature cannot
choose the creature that bestowed the affliction as the
target of its attacks. <p></p>

<h2>Compelled</h2>
A compelled creature cannot use actions or move. Instead, the creature that
bestowed the affliction can force the compelled creature
to move or to use an action. The creature
that bestowed the affliction makes all decisions on the
compelled creature’s behalf. <p></p>

<h2>Dazed</h2>
A dazed creature cannot use actions. <p></p>

<h2>Deafened</h2>
You cannot hear.<p></p>

<h2>Defenseless</h2>
A defenseless creature cannot defend itself. Its Defense
is 5, it cannot use actions, and its Attribute Rolls result in failure. The creature can still perceive its
surroundings. <p></p>

<h2>Impaired</h2>
An impaired creature makes all Attribute Rolls with 1 bane. <p></p>

<h2>Poisoned</h2>
A poisoned creature makes all Attribute Rolls with 1 bane. <p></p>

<h2>Prone</h2>
A prone creature lies on the ground. Other creatures can
move through its space. While prone, the creature can
move by crawling or can use its move to stand up. The
prone creature makes Strength and Agility rolls with 1 bane.
Creatures that can reach the prone creature make all attribute rolls
 against it with 1 boon, while creatures that cannot
reach it make attribute rolls against its Defense with 1 bane<p></p>

<h2>Sickened</h2>
A Sickened creature makes all Attribute Rolls with 1 bane. <p></p>

<h2>Slippery</h2>
The creature’s moves do not enable other
creatures to make free attacks against it. <p></p>

<h2>Slowed</h2>
A slowed creature cannot Take the Initiative, its
Speed is halved, and it cannot benefit from increases to Speed. <p></p>


<h2>Strained</h2>
You make all  Attribute Rolls with 1 bane. <p></p>


<h2>Stunned</h2>
A stunned creature cannot move or use actions. The
creature automatically gets a failure on any Attribute rolls
it would make. Other creatures make all Attribute rolls against
the stunned creature with 1 boon.<p></p>

<h2>Unconscious</h2>
An unconscious creature is unable to act, move, or perceive
its surroundings. The creature’s Defense is 5. It cannot use
actions or move, and all its Attribute rolls result in failure.

				<h2>Disposition</h2>
How a person sees you, whether they like you or
not, can go a long way toward deciding whether
they are willing to help you. A friendly person is
more likely to do you a favor than will an
indifferent one. Creatures you meet have a
disposition toward you, other characters in your
group, and other people as well. The dispositions
follow: <p></p>
<b>Friendly</b> The person likes you and helps you if
they can. <br>
<b>Indifferent</b> The person has no opinion toward
you, one way or the other. <br>
<b>Unfriendly</b> The person dislikes you and helps
you only if they have no choice.<p>

</p>
<h2>Reading Dispositions</h2>
Unless a person has some reason to hide their
disposition, how they see you should be evident in
what they say and how they act around you. If a
person hides their true feelings from you, the Sage
might make Will rolls for the person to see if they
can keep their true feelings to themselves. Rather
than ask to make a roll, spend time with the
character in question, observe them, and talk to
them. The truth will come out eventually. Magic
might also reveal a person’s true feelings.
<p>	</p>

<h2>Social Challenges</h2>
A social challenge happens whenever you cause
another creature to behave in a certain way by
using conversation. The desired behavior
responsible for the social challenge can be almost
anything, from the revelation of a secret to some
action you want the subject to perform. In each
case, though, the behavior represents something
the person would not normally do, from risks,
disinterest, or dislike. <p></p>

				<h2>Battlefield</h2>
				A combat takes place on a battlefield, a place large
enough to encompass all the combatants. The Sage describes the battlefield
before the combat begins and notes any obvious
features and threats present. The Sage
will sketch out the battlefield into
discrete zones to give you a visual representation. <p></p>

<h2>Turns</h2>
Each round, all the combatants under the Sage’s
control take their turns first, acting in any order
the Sage chooses. Each combatant must complete
its turn before another can take its turn. The Sage can change the order in which these combatants
resolve their turn each round. <p></p>
Once all combatants under the Sage’s control
have taken their turns, the players take their turns.
Players can declare they are taking their turns in
any order they like each round. <p></p>

<h2>Reactions</h2>
Each combatant can act out of turn just once each
round by using a reaction. <p></p>

<h2>Combat Circumstances</h2>
				Certain circumstances can make attacking harder
					or easier. The following situations represent those
					most commonly encountered in a fight. <p></p>

					<b>Surrounded Target</b> When you make a melee
attack against a target that has been attacked by
an ally using a melee weapon in the same round,
you roll with 1 boon.<p></p>

<b>Long Range Shooting</b> When you make a ranged
attack you can target a creature beyond your
weapon’s range, but no more than twice its range.
You roll to attack with 1 bane. <p></p>

<b>High Ground</b> When you occupy a space higher
than that occupied by the target of your attack,
you roll with 1 boon. <p></p>

<b>Within Reach of an Enemy</b> If you make a
ranged attack while in the reach of at least one
enemy, you roll with 1 bane. <p></p>

<b>Obscurement</b> You roll to attack with 1 bane
while you are in an area affected by obscurement
of any kind. <p></p>

<b>Invisible</b> If you can’t see the target, but have a
general idea about the target’s location, you roll
with 3 banes. <p></p>

<b>Cover</b> A target positioned behind an obstacle of
its size or larger (which can be a creature or an
object) has partial cover from enemies that can
see any part of its body, but not all of it. Partial
cover imposes 1 bane on rolls against the covered
target’s Defense and Agility, and grants the target
1 boon on Agility rolls made to resist harmful
effects originating from beyond cover. <p></p>
A target has total cover from enemies if there is
no line of sight to it because the target is behind an
obstacle and cannot be seen by an enemy. Such a
target cannot be directly attacked or affected by an
effect unless the rules say otherwise. Instead,
attacks against the target strike the obstacle. If the
obstacle is destroyed as a result, any additional
damage dealt by that attack or effect is applied to
whatever was behind the obstacle. <p></p>
Note that these rules apply in situations when
an attacker cannot position itself to get a clear
shot against a target. <p>	</p>

				<h2>Moves</h2>
You can move a number of yards equal to your
Speed score using your primary mode of
locomotion—walking, rolling, slithering, or
fluttering.
You can spend yards of movement to move in
special ways.<p></p>

<b>Climb</b>
You can climb surfaces that have handholds and
footholds, or when you have a rope. For every 2
yards of movement you expend, you can climb up,
down, or across a distance of 1 yard.<p></p>

<b>Crawl</b>
You crawl while prone. For every 2 yards of
movement, you crawl 1 yard across a surface on
which you lay prone.<p></p>

<b>Drop Prone</b>
You can expend 1 yard of movement to drop to the
surface on which you are standing. You become
prone.<p></p>

<b>Fly</b>
If you can fly, thanks to a trait, magical talent, or
spell, you can fly 2 yards for yard of movement you
expend. Once airborne, you remain so until you
land, the effect enabling your ability fly ends, or
something causes you to land. <p></p>

<b>Jump and Leap</b>
You can expend 2 yards of movement to jump or
leap. <p></p>

<b>Mount and Dismount</b>
You can expend 3 yards of movement to mount a
friendly Mount within reach or dismount a Mount
you are riding. When you
dismount, you move from the creature’s space into
an empty space of your choice within 1 yard of the
mount. <p></p>

<b>Retreat</b>
When you are in the reach of an enemy, you can
retreat to safely move out of its reach. For each
yard you would move, expend 1 additional yard of
movement, preventing the enemy from making a
free attack against you. <p></p>

<b>Sneak</b>
You attempt to move without making much, if any,
sound. For every 2 yards of movement you spend,
you sneak 1 yard across the surface on which you
are standing.<p></p>

<b>Stand Up</b>
If you are prone, you can expend 4 yards of
movement to stand up, thus ending the prone
affliction.<p></p>

<b>Swim</b>
You can swim in just about any liquid, though
immersing yourself in acid or toxic goo is never a
good idea. For every 2 yards of movement you
expend, you swim 1 yard in any direction inside
the liquid.<p></p>

<b>Teleportation</b>
Magical effects can transport you, along with
whatever you are wearing and carrying, from one
place to another in an instant. When you appear in
the new location, you do so in the same
orientation and posture had when you left the
previous position. <P></P>

<h2>Movement Activities</h2>
You can spend movement to perform minor
activities chosen from the following options by
expending 2 yards of movement for each activity:<br>
• Open an unlocked door, open a chest, or some
other container in your reach.<br>
• Retrieve an item from your backpack or some
other container you carry.<br>
• Pick something up off the ground.<br>
• Pull a lever or interact with an object in reach.<br>
• Any other physical activity that involves
movement and does not require an attribute roll
either to perform it or resist it.<br><p></p>

<h2>Movement Complications</h2>
Various complications, coming from effects that
target you or from the nature of your
environment, might restrict your movement. <p></p>

<b>Being Moved</b>
An effect that forces you to move propels you in
the direction and to the distance indicated unless
you encounter an obstacle that prevents you from
continuing to move. If being moved would expose
you to peril, such as pushing you over the edge of a
cliff or into a fire, you can make a luck roll and, on
a success, you drop prone at the edge of the
danger. Being moved in this way does not enable
enemies to make free attack against you.<p></p>

<b>Moving Out of Reach</b>
If you move out of the reach of one or more
enemies, you trigger a free attack from each
enemy whose reach you leave. <p></p>

				<h2>Rest</h2>
Characters have many ways to heal <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and
regain <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. They might avail themselves of
poultices, elixirs, spells, talents, and other game
effects. But the most reliable way to recover from
injuries comes from resting. <p></p>
Resting allows you to heal <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and regain
expended resources. If you have uninterrupted
rest for 8 consecutive hours, you heal all <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>,
and you regain <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> equal one-tenth your
normal <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score (round down). Some of your
other resources might also be replenished after a
rest. If you stop resting to use an action or
<a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a>, the time you have spent continuously
resting is wasted and you must start resting again
to gain any benefit from doing so.<p></p>

<h2>Knowledge</h2>
			 All people know how to do certain things and can
				agree that some things count as facts. As a person
				living in this world, you know the following things.
				This list isn’t meant to be exhaustive; it sketches
				out the parameters for what a typical person
				ought to know.<br>
				• How to build and maintain a fire. <br>
				• How to forage for food.<br>
				• How to dress and prepare meat from animal
				you kill.<br>
				• How to identify water that’s safe to drink.<br>
• How to make use of all the equipment.<br>
• How to maintain your equipment.<br>
• The basic features of the land you inhabit
and what’s around these lands.<br>
• That magic exists. You also know the gods
sometimes walk the lands and bestow
powers onto their servants.<br>
• A bit about the major religions, their
doctrines, and their dogma.<br>
• How to care for and feed an animal.<br>
• How to conduct commerce.<br>
• How to feed, clothe, bathe yourself, and tend
to your other physical needs.<br>
• How to read and write.<br>
• The seasons and their passage, weather, the
major constellations, and other phenomena
related to living in a world.<br>
• Identify common creatures you see.<br>
• Anything else that a person would know
who lives in a pre-industrial society.<br> <p></p>

<h2>Professional Knowledge</h2>

In addition to knowledge held in common with
most other people, you also have knowledge
related to your profession, as well as to the paths
you have chosen.<p></p>

<b>Stories and Legends</b> You can recall details
about legendary members of your profession, as
well as famous and infamous members of your
profession from in and around the lands in which
you live. If you are a blacksmith and have worked
as a blacksmith in a particular town, you know if
there’s a famous blacksmith the next town over.
<p></p>

<b>Tasks and Activities</b> You know how to perform
tasks and activities directly related to your
profession. If you’re a scribe, you know how to
illuminate a manuscript. If you’re a poet, you can
produce poetry. If you are a criminal, you can
probably unlock a lock using lockpicks.
For difficult tasks directly related to your
profession, you and you alone can perform the
task. A person who is not a forger could not
produce a believable forgery, for example. In
addition, when performing such tasks, the Sage
might grant an automatic success or 1 boon or
more to your <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> roll.

<p></p>
<b>Competence</b> You count as being competent in
any work you perform related to your profession.
Between quests, if you can find work, you know
how to perform in your profession with the ability
to provide for yourself at a quality of life typical
for a member of your profession.

<p></p>
<b>Eye for Quality</b> You can identify the quality of
any good or service produced by a member of
your profession. You can identify good writing if a
writer, good or bad cooking as a cook, fine or
terrible service if a servant.

<p></p>
<b>Tangential Benefits</b> Your profession might also
grant benefits on tasks not directly related to your
work at the Sage’s discretion. The benefit might
make an impossible task possible for you, or make
difficult tasks easier. The Sage might also reveal
additional information in descriptions based on
your expertise. <p></p>

<h2>Deprivation</h2>
If you are a living being, you need food and water
to survive. If you go without either, you suffer
deprivation until you expire. Normally, provisions
and waterskins can keep these effects at bay, but if
you run out of water or someone makes off with
your food, you might be in trouble. You need to
spend at least 1 hour each day eating at least two
meals and drinking at least a half-gallon of water.
A small creature requires half these quantities,
while a large creature required four times these
amounts or more.
<p></p>
Each day you go without drinking sufficient
amounts of water, you lose 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. Every two
days you go without eating, you lose 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a>. If
your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> drops to 5 or lower, you fall prone and
become <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> until your <a href="#chi"><b>Health</b></a> score
increases above 5. While <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> in this way,
you cannot stand up and can move only by
crawling. <p></p>

<h2>Sleep Deprivation</h2>
You need sleep to refresh yourself. Unless your
ancestry says otherwise, you need at least six
hours of sleep every day. If you go a day without
sleep, you become <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a> until you do sleep.
Every day you go without sleep thereafter, you
take 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.

				<h2>Attack</h2>
				You attack when you use a weapon, natural
				weapon, improvised weapon, or an unarmed to
				harm a creature or object.  <p></p>

				<b>Weapons</b>
				A weapon is an object constructed for the purpose
				of harming others and includes swords, axes, and
				the like. A weapon is either melee, for use in handto-
				hand combat, or ranged. Many weapons have
				properties that can affect how you use them.<p></p>

				<b>Natural Weapons</b>
				A natural weapon is part of the creature’s body
				that can harm others. Examples include horns,
				spiked tails, claws, and teeth. A creature with a
				natural weapon is always wielding a melee
				weapon and cannot be disarmed. For the purpose
				of attacking with two weapons, natural weapons
				count as off-hand weapons.<p></p>

				<b>Improvised Weapons</b>
				An improvised weapon is an object constructed
				for a function other than harm but nevertheless
				can cause injury. Examples include frying pans and
				broken bottles. When you use an improvised
				weapon to attack, you roll with 1 bane. If the result
				of the roll is 0 or less or 20 or higher, the
				improvised weapon breaks. An improvised
				weapon deals 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> and derives no benefit

<h2>Attack Options</h2>

Once per <a href="#gen"><b>round</b></a>, when you use an action to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>,
you can avail yourself of one of the following
attack options provided you meet the
requirements for doing so. To use an attack option,
you must have at least 1 a boon on your roll to
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, after accounting for banes. You then
discard any remaining a <a href="#boon"><b>boons</b></a> and resolve the
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> as normal, with the following additional
effects.
<p></p>

<b>Aggressive Attack</b>  
You can use this option
when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with a weapon that has a onehanded
or two-handed grip If the result is a
success, add half your level (minimum 1) as extra
damage to the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>.<p></p>

<b>Combination Attack</b> You can use this option if
you have at least one hand free. On a success, you
can make an unarmed attack against the same
target you attacked.<p></p>

<b>Distracting Attack</b> 
On a success, the target also
grants 1 boon on the next roll to attack it before
the start of your next turn.<p></p>

<b>Driving Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> a target of your size + 1 or smaller with
a weapon that has a one-handed or two-handed
grip or you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with any weapon while you
have a shield equipped. On a success, you also
push the target up to 5 yards. <p></p>

<b>Feinting Attack</b> You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> when you wield weapon with a onehanded
or off-handed grip, but not a two-handed
grip. On a success, you also become Slippery until
the end of your turn.

<b>Guarded Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> while you are equipped with a shield or
you have a weapon in your off-hand. On a success,
you also impose 1 bane on rolls to <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you until
the start of your next turn. The benefit ends early
if you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused, held, stunned, or
	unconscious</b></a>. <p></p>


<b>Lunging Attack</b> 
You can use this option when
you wield a weapon that has one-handed or twohanded
grip. You can increase your reach by 1
yard for the purpose of choosing a target for the
<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> you make with the weapon you are
wielding. However, on a success, the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> deals
half damage. <p></p>

<b>Pressing Attack</b> 
On a success, the target also
makes its next roll to attack before the start of
your next turn with 1 bane. <p></p>


<h2>Unarmed Attacks</h2> 
					There are several ways to make an unarmed
					<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, each of which are described below. <p></p>
					<b>Unarmed Strike</b>
You punch, kick, elbow, or headbutt. Choose one
creature in reach. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> roll with 1 bane
against the target’s <a href="#chi"><b>Defense</b></a>. On a success, the
target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>. If the target is larger
than you, it instead takes 1 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.
					<p> <b>Shove</b>
						You attempt to shove a creature away from you.
						Choose one creature in reach whose size is no
						more than 2 higher than yours. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a>
						roll against the target’s <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a>. You roll with 1
						boon if you are using a shield and 1 boon if you
						moved at least 5 yards before you make the
						attempt. On a success, you push the target a
						number of yards away from you equal to your
						<a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> modifier (minimum 1). If the target is
						larger than you, it moves half the distance
						(minimum 0) instead. If the result of your roll is 20
						or higher, the target falls prone.

						<p></p>
						<b>Trip</b>
						You attempt to knock a creature to the ground.
Choose one creature in your reach whose size is
no more than 2 higher than yours. Make an <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>
roll against the target’s choice of <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or
<a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. If you are using a shield, you roll with 1
boon. On a success, the target falls prone. If the
result of your roll is 20 or higher, the target’s
Speed drops to 0 until the start of your next turn. <p></p>
<b>Grab</b>
You try to grab a creature. Choose one creature in
your reach whose size is no more than 1 higher
than yours. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against
the target's <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. You succeed automatically
against a <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> creature. On a success, the target
becomes <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> until the end of your next turn. The
<a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a> ends early if you release the target,
which you can do freely. The effect also ends if you
move away from the target without dragging it
(see Drag) or you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>controlled</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>stunned</b></a>, or <a href="#iad"><b>unconscious</b></a>.
If you have a target grabbed, you can use an
action extend the duration until the end of your
next turn.
<p></p>
<b>Drag</b>
You attempt to pull a creature you have <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> with
you. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> roll against the <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> of a creature <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> by your successful grab. On a
success, you move as normal and the creature
moves with you. <p></p>

<b>Wrestle</b>
You attempt to wrestle down a creature you have
grabbed. Make a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against the
target’s choice of <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a>. On a success,
you can choose one of the following effects:
<br>• The target falls prone and the grab effect ends.
<br>• You and the target falls prone.
<br>• The target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.
<br>• If you and the target are both prone, you pin the
target. A pinned creature is <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a>, and cannot stand up until the effect
ends. The target remains until you release it,
which you can do at any time, you stand up or
you use an action to do anything other than
wrestle the target. Also, you release a target
automatically if you become <a href="#aff"><b>confused</b></a>, <a href="#aff"><b>impaired</b></a>,
<a href="#aff"><b>stunned</b></a>, or <a href="#aff"><b>weakened</b></a>. <p></p>

<b> Escape</b>
If you are <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> from being grabbed or pinned, you
can attempt to escape by making a <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or
<a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll against the <a href="#att"><b>Strength</b></a> or <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> of the
creature that has you <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a>. On a success, you end
the <a href="#aff"><b>held</b></a> <a href="#aff"><b>affliction</b></a>. If the result of your roll is 20 or
higher and exceeds the target number by at least
5, you can also automatically grab the creature
that had grabbed you or pin the creature that had
you pinned provided the creature can be a
legitimate target for your grab. <p></p>

<h2>Special Attacks</h2> 
					You might avail yourself of the special attacks
commonly available to most creatures.
					<p> <b>Attacking with Two Weapons </b>
						If you wield two
						weapons, one in each hand, you can <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with
						both weapons at the same time. When you do so,
						only the properties from the weapon you wield in
						your main hand apply. If the <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> results in a
						success, add the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> from the weapon you
						wield in your off-hand as extra <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> to the
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>.
						If you can wield more than two weapons at a
						time, you can, at most, <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> with two weapons
						and choose which weapons with which you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>
						when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>. <p></p>

						<b>Called Shot </b>
						You make a called shot when you
						target for a particular location on a target’s body
						or something the target wears or carries. You roll
						with 1 bane when you make a called shot for your
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>. On a success and if you targeted a spot on
						the target’s body, the target becomes <a href="#aff"><b>impaired</b></a> in
						an <a href="#att"><b>attribute</b></a> of your choice until the end of your
						next turn. If you targeted something the target
						wears or carries, the object takes the <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>
						instead. <p></p>

						<b>Charge</b>
						 Use an action to charge one creature or
						object you can see. Double your Speed score until
						the end of your turn. If you move toward the target
						and can reach it before the end of your turn, you
						can <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> it with a weapon or an unarmed <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>,
						but you roll with 1 bane. <p></p>

						<b>Disarm</b> 
						Use an action to attempt to disarm a
						creature of your size or smaller when you <a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a> it.
						You roll with 1 bane if you use make a melee
						<a href="#atta"><b>attack</b></a>, 2 banes if you use an improvised weapon,
						or 3 banes if you use a ranged weapon. On a
						success, the target takes no <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a> (<a href="#chi"><b>bonus damage</b></a> does not apply), but makes an <a href="#att"><b>Agility</b></a> roll
						and drops one object it holds in its hands on the
						failure. If you can reach the target, you can use a
						<a href="#gen"><b>reactions</b></a> to catch the object. If the result of your
						roll is 20 or higher, the target takes 1d6 <a href="#chi"><b>damage</b></a>.
